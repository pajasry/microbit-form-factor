## Edge connector
PCB ready for classic microbit [connector](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/edgeconnector/). Great footprint for its counter part could be found [here](https://github.com/anthonykirby/kicad_microbit_connector).

## Solderable standoffs
Cheap and dirty solution if you are okay with the use of big pads only. In combination of 3mm screws and standoffs it is the fastes solution.
